# Measuring behavioral change within mobile app usage
This special course aims at studying temporal behaviour of smartphone and mobile app users, with special focus at changes in usage. The analysis of smartphone and app behaviour will rely on time series techniques to detect change points and forecast shifts in usage. In particular, we will leverage both univariate and multivariate timeseries approaches to identify underlying patterns of usage at the aggregated and app level.
